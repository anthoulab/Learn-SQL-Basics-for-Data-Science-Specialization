Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537 (with the foreign key user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: For each of the column of user table we have to run this query: 

SELECT *
FROM user
WHERE id = NULL OR name = NULL OR review_count = NULL OR yelping_since = NULL OR useful = NULL OR funny = NULL OR cool = NULL OR fans = NULL OR average_stars = NULL OR compliment_hot = NULL OR compliment_more = NULL OR compliment_profile = NULL OR compliment_cute = NULL OR compliment_list = NULL OR compliment_note = NULL OR compliment_plain = NULL OR compliment_cool = NULL OR compliment_funny = NULL OR compliment_writer = NULL OR compliment_photos = NULL;
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.00	max:	5.00	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min:	1	max:	53	avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min:	0	max:	2000	avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating.
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City: Edinburgh	Category: Pets

The given problem and what we have to do is a little bit confusing. So, I choose Edinburg as a city and get the business in this city, the star rating of these and the hours that are open.\
I asuumed that the two groups that I had to compare are businesses with 2-3 stars (1st group) and businesses with 4-5 stars (2nd group). So, the answers below is from this assumption.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, businesses with 2 stars have 22:30-3:00 as hours, while businesses with 4 stars have 12:00-22:30.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, the second group has more reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
From the location data we observe that the worst rated business (Mood with 2 stars) and the best rated business (Miros Cantina Mexicana with 4 stars) are in the same neighborhood. 

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT b.name, b.city, b.stars, b.review_count, h.hours, b.neighborhood, b.postal_code
FROM business AS b INNER JOIN hours AS h ON h.business_id = b.id
WHERE b.city = 'Edinburgh'

Results:

+------------------------+-----------+-------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+-------------+
| name                   | city      | stars | review_count | hours                 | neighborhood | postal_code |

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed.
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed?
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

There are 8480 open businesses and 1520 closed.
		
i. Difference 1:
Businesses that are open have a higher average of reviews.
         
ii. Difference 2:
Business that are open have a little higher average of stars rating.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(id) number_of_businesses, is_open, AVG(review_count), AVG(stars)
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open


Results:
+----------------------+---------+-------------------+---------------+
| number_of_businesses | is_open | AVG(review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+----------------------+---------+-------------------+---------------+
|                 1520 |       0 |     23.1980263158 | 3.52039473684 |
|                 8480 |       1 |     31.7570754717 | 3.67900943396 |

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Analysing restaurants by cousine category. I have included cuisines from Asia (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian) and Greek cuisine as I am from Greece.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I get data from category table of business (choose 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Indian, 'Greek') and picked up from business table information data, such as the name of the business, the city, the state, star rating and reviews per restaurant.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+--------------------------------+----------+----------------+-------+-------+---------------+
| name                           | category | city           | state | stars | total_reviews |

| Royal Dumpling                 | Chinese  | Toronto        | ON    |   1.5 |             4 |
+--------------------------------+----------+----------------+-------+-------+---------------+

As we can see better there are a few food businesses with cuisine from each country from Asia, but only two restaurants with Greek cuisine. Maybe this happens because of the increasing popularity for these cuisines. We also see that the restaraunts with higher star rating have few reviews.


iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT b.name, c.category, b.city, b.state, b.stars, SUM(review_count) as total_reviews
FROM business AS b INNER JOIN category AS c ON b.id = c.business_id
WHERE c.category = 'Chinese' OR c.category = 'Japanese' OR c.category = 'Korean' OR c.category = 'Indian' OR c.category = 'Greek' 
GROUP BY b.name, c.category
ORDER BY b.stars DESC
